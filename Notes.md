- JSX

1. JSX uses React.createElement() behind the scenes
2. JSX is converted to JavaScript
3. JSX -> React.createElement() -> Object -> HTML(DOM)
4. Babel converts the JSX into javascript

- React Components

1. Functional Components - NEW
2. Class based Components - OLD

- Functional component: It is a function which returns some peice of react element
- It is a convention (not necessarily) to write a component name starting with a capital letter
- We can write any piece of JS code inside {} braces
- Component Composition : Using component inside a component

React Fragment: A jsx in react can have only one parent element. To overcome this issue, <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> or <></> is used to contain multiple parent element inside a jsx.

Config Driven UI: Controlling our frontend driven by a config given from backend.
